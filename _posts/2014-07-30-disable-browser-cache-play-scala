Prevent the browser to cache every page could be very useful in dev enviroments. Here is a quick tip on how disable it on Scala with Play! <!--more--> using the
http header PRAGMA(the Cache-control header could also be used).

In your Global object, add the followings methods

{% gist maiostri/627491f56998d85a1ed1 %}

The NoCache function is reponsible for adding the header, and the onRouteRequest is the
responsible method for intercepting every request routed by Play.

Hope it could useful for you!
